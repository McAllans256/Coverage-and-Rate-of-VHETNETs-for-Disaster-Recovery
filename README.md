# Coverage-and-Rate-of-VHETNETs-for-Disaster-Recovery
This project aims at improving the coverage and achievable data rate in VHetNets, as well as providing optimum deployment of the ABSs in cases of disaster recovery
Using knowledge of probability theory and stochastic geometry, analytical expressions for the time-varying coverage and rate for both the ABSs are derived first. 
The derived expressions are proven by monte-carlo simulations carried out in Matlab and Octave software applications. 
The framework considers two user-service models for mobile ABSs moving at constant speeds... 
The first service model considers the serving ABS moving independently to the user’s location. 
The second service model considers the serving ABS maintaining a minimum distance as projected from the user’s location. 
An interactive tool is developed to compute different metrics such as...
height, coverage radius and elevation angle for Air-to-Ground (A2G) communication in order to
visualize optimal deployment of the ABSs
